      Week 5: git and GitHub This week, you'll practise with git flow. Follow
      these steps to connect a local repository to a remote one on GitHub.
      Before following these steps, you'll need to install git:
      https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git 1️⃣ Create a
      folder on your computer and add files for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 📚 2️⃣
      Add some content to the HTML, link the CSS and add a script tag which
      points to your JS. 3️⃣ Open up your terminal and navigate to the folder
      where you've saved your files. Initialise this folder as a git repository.
      🐙 4️⃣ Stage and commit your changes. 5️⃣ Create a remote repository on
      GitHub. The easiest way to set this up is without a README since GitHub
      will then give you instructions to connect with your local repository. ☁️
      💻 6️⃣ Connect your local and remote repositories. Push your changes from
      your local machine to the remote. 🔗 7️⃣ Deploy your site to GitHub Pages.
      ⚡ Once you have a local and remote repository connected, you'll be able
      to keep both in sync by regularly staging, committing and pushing your
      changes to GitHub. Getting into the habit of doing this regularly will
      help you make sure your codebase is backed up and version-controlled. 🌱
